# Learn Terraform with Azure 
Welcome to the Learn Terraform repository — a hands-on companion to my blog series at [blog.adrianrubico.com](https://blog.adrianrubico.com/tag/learn-terraform/). This repository is designed to help you follow along with the Terraform examples and workflows covered in each post.

Each folder includes:

.tf files containing the Terraform code.
